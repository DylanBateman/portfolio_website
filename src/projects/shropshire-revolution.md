**Project Overview:**

Shropshire Revolution American Football team approached me with a critical need: establishing their web online presence. Recognising the importance of a strong digital footprint in today's sporting landscape, they sought a website that would serve multiple key objectives:

I worked closely with the Head Coach and General Manager to thoroughly understand their vision and specific requirements. This involved in-depth discussions to define:

- **Target Audience:** Identifying the key demographics for player recruitment and potential partnerships.
- **Key Information:** Determining the essential content to be featured, such as team history, roster / coaches, schedule, contact information, and potential sponsorship packages.
- **Design Preferences:** Understanding their desired aesthetic â€“ modern, stylish, and reflective of the team's spirit.
- **Future Scalability:** Considering potential future needs and ensuring the website architecture could accommodate growth.

I strategically chose **Astro** as the foundation for this project. Its lightweight nature and focus on content-driven websites offered several key advantages:
